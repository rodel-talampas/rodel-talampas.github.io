    title: Career Profile
    summary: |
      Currently working as the Technical Lead / Solutions Architect at oOh! Media. After graduating at De La Salle University 
      Dasmarinas (Cavite, Philippines) in 1997, I ventured into Teaching to share my knowledge with the new breed of Computer 
      Scientists. The call of the IT Industry though snatched me away from Teaching in 2000. I climbed the ranks from there on.
      Started with VB6 and jumped to Java for 15 years before being language-agnostic (Python, Node.JS, Terraform, Cloudformation, YAML)
      shifting to cloud-based technologies.
